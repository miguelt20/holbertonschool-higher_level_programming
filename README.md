 <h2><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106556795/225409959-3651d90a-def3-4919-be4c-de6c8f1cca6c.png" width="30px" /> Python </h2>

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.

Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.

Here are some of the topics that you can find in the Python directories:

 - if/else
 - Loops
 - Functions
 - import & modules
 - Lists & Tuples
 - Set & Dictionaries
 - Exceptions
 - Classes & Objects
 - Test-driven Development
 - Inheritance
 - Input/Ouput
 - Flask

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a database. According to ANSI (American National Standards Institute), it is the standard language for relational database management systems. SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data on a database, or retrieve data from a database. Some common relational database management systems that use SQL are: Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server, Access, Ingres, etc.

Here are some of the commands used in the SQL exercises:

- CREATE
- ALTER
- SELECT
- INSERT
- UPDATE
- DELETE
- WHERE / FROM
- PRIMARY KEY
- FOREIGN KEY
- NOT NULL
- UNIQUE
- JOIN
- UNION

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source server environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment, runs on the V8 JavaScript Engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting. The ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application development around a single programming language, as opposed to using different languages for the server- versus client-side programming.

Here are some of the topics that you can find in the JavaScript directories:

- Variables
- Data types
- if / else
- Loops
- Functions
- Scope
- Module Patterns
- Classes
- Objects
- Super, extends, inheritance
- this / self
- requiere
- JSON data
- DOM
- Fetch
- JQuery
